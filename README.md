### Phd Project

#### 1. eyetracking code for infant data
This is a git repo for Matlab codes for analyzing infant eye-tracking(Tobbi, 300Hz) & adult behavioral data.

For infants, the experimental paradigm was modified based on Maye, Werker and Gerken (2002). There is one version for it (see eyecoding_infants.m)

#### 2. bahavioral code for adult data 

For adults, the experimental paradigm was modified based on Maye and Gerken (2000) with *Psyscope* and *Eprime*, thus two different Matlab files. Run separately (e.g., eyecoding_psyscope_adults.m for data from *Psyscope* and eyecoding_eprime_adults.m for data from *Eprime* file), then run eyecoding_allcombined_adults.m at the end.

#### 3. misc 
1. 3 example files for audio stimulus creation
2. 2 example files for checking coders' agreement for video analyses
